# Employee List

This is a simple Angular Single-Page Application that features a list of trainees that can be displayed in one component and updated to add more trainees from another component. When the list is displayed, simple logic using ngIf statements are used to determine eligibility for promotion. Components communicate with each other using @Input/@Output properties to pass data and EventEmitters to call each other's functions.
* This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. A new browser tab should open to `http://localhost:4200/`, or navigate there manually. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
